# React Registration Form

This project is a simple registration form built with `create-react-app`. The form comes with key input fields including: a text input for user names, another text input for emails, a checkbox to agree to terms, and two radio buttons for gender selection. The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly way for users to register.

The application emphasizes quality and security. It includes unit tests that cover both positive and negative test cases to ensure robust functionality. We have written 10 comprehensive tests using the `react-testing-library` with `jest` as our test runner. To further enhance our code quality and security, we've connected the project to SonarCloud.io. This provides continuous monitoring and feedback on the quality, safety, and potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## Running Tests Locally

If you wish to run the tests locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Before running the tests, make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed. If you haven't done so, navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the tests using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

This will initiate `jest` and `react-testing-library` and run all the unit tests. Upon completion, you'll see a summary of the tests that passed or failed.

For more comprehensive information on tests or if you encounter issues, please refer to the official documentation of [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

Thank you for your interest in our React Registration Form. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are always welcome!
